# 📦 Ecommerce Project — Python + MySQL

This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate **SQL** and **Python** for real-world data analysis tasks. The notebook outlines a complete workflow for **loading data from a MySQL database into Python using `pandas`**, preparing it for analysis, and deriving insights from raw relational data.

It is ideal for **data analysts** and **learners** aiming to bridge SQL with Python for end-to-end analytics workflows.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this notebook, we:

- Establish a connection to a **MySQL database** using `SQLAlchemy` and `PyMySQL`
- Extract data directly using **SQL queries**
- Load results into **pandas DataFrames** for manipulation and analysis
- Explore and understand the schema and content of each table
- Visualize key insights such as customer distribution, sales performance, and revenue trends
