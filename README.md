# 📦 Ecommerce- Python+MySQL Project

This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate **SQL** and **Python** for data analysis tasks. The notebook provides a complete workflow for **loading data from a MySQL database into Python using `pandas`**, preparing it for analysis, and exploring its structure.

It is ideal for **data analysts** and **learners** aiming to bridge SQL with Python for end-to-end data processing.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this notebook, we:

* Establish a connection to a **MySQL database** using `SQLAlchemy` and `PyMySQL`
* Extract data directly from the database using **SQL queries**
* Load the results into **pandas DataFrames** for analysis
* Preview and understand the **schema** and sample data from each table
